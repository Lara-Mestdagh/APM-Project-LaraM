TODO:
- if server is not on, still start client with retry conenction screen?
- login not going to dashboard with standard user
- register only sometimes work
- need error handling in the client gui
- make a txt log of client actions?




Zie demo networking 3
multi-threaded server
each client makes a clienthandler object

zie demo networking 5
Zorg er voor dat alle threads correct kunnen afgesloten worden
• Zorgt het sluiten van de serversocket ervoor dat geconnecteerde
cliënts niet meer kunnen communiceren?
• Event mbt sluiten van de GUI verzorgen zowel langs cliënt/server.



Planned possibilities:
- Graph all villagers by race, personality, and hobby.
- Search all villagers by filtering by race, personality, birthday, and hobby.

- Show the details/info of a client.
- Show each client's search options history.
- Be able to send a message to a client.
- Show the most popular search options.
- Close the server.

Client capabilities:
- Be able to log in and out.
- Send out searches with parameters.
- Show results of searches (will be text, graphs, images).
- Show messages coming from the server.

Important:
- Clients need to register with name, nickname, and email.
- Moderators can always check who is online.
- The minimal info of a client is saved somewhere (separate dataset?).
- Moderator can ask for the details of all clients.
- Client can ask for different searches, with if needed extra parameters; searches happen server-side with available data.
- Client does not have access to the dataset.
- Given results of clients are shown in a graphical way.
- Server moderator keeps track of asked searches.
- Server moderator can check which searches are popular.
- Server moderator can send a warning to clients.
