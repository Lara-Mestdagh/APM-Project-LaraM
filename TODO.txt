Planned possibilities:
- Graph all villagers by race, personality, and hobby.
- Search all villagers by filtering by race, personality, birthday, and hobby.
- Graph showing all catchphrases by beginning letter, amount of words, and amount of letters.
- Show the amount of birthdays per month.

Server capabilities:
- Check important actions in the logging window.
- Overview of logged-in clients.
- Show the details/info of a client.
- Show each client's search options history.
- Be able to send a message to a client.
- Show the most popular search options.
- Close the server.

Client capabilities:
- Be able to log in and out.
- Send out searches with parameters.
- Show results of searches (will be text, graphs, images).
- Show messages coming from the server.

Important:
- Clients need to register with name, nickname, and email.
- Moderators can always check who is online.
- The minimal info of a client is saved somewhere (separate dataset?).
- Moderator can ask for the details of all clients.
- Client can ask for different searches, with if needed extra parameters; searches happen server-side with available data.
- Client does not have access to the dataset.
- Given results of clients are shown in a graphical way.
- Server moderator keeps track of asked searches.
- Server moderator can check which searches are popular.
- Server moderator can send a warning to clients.

Ideas:
- Connect a second dataset with an image of each villager? Or somehow combine those datasets?
