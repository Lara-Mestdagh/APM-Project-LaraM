TODO:
Basic Interface Enhancements:
Implement the buttons for requesting client details. This can be a simple form or dialog box that opens when you select a client from the logged-in list.
Setup pop-up notifications on the client side that can display messages or warnings sent from the server.
Logging and Monitoring:
Enhance the server's logging window to include more detailed logs (e.g., timestamped entries, type of request, client ID).
Implement a feature to view each client's search options history in a more organized manner, possibly with filters for date, search type, etc.

Zorg er voor dat alle threads correct kunnen afgesloten worden
• Zorgt het sluiten van de serversocket ervoor dat geconnecteerde
cliënts niet meer kunnen communiceren?
• Event mbt sluiten van de GUI verzorgen zowel langs cliënt/server.
