started with reading the assigment and making a TODO list of functionalities, I also looked up what some standard python folder
structure was and found the src method most logical

First I did some looking at the labs we made and searched online before finding customtinker. 
With this I first make a server that can connect with multiple clients, each client can message the server 
and the server can pick which clients to message. This took about a day of work

Next I started working on the login system, this gave me the most trouble but I looked up some examples of python server and client
log in systems to help me out. 
The plan is to keep the user details hashed in a txt file in my data folder.
I decided it was better to use a clienthandler and added this to the server folder, then I used pickle to get the login to work.

I took a lot of work for me to figure out how to get a better GUI, a proper login with connected clients shown and being able to send messages to and from each other.
The next step was a bit easier to implement the registration.
I decided to add some simple checks, the main one being that usernames are unique, an email check and passwords need at least 4 characters.
A last check was just to make sure the input can't be too long, it is now max 32 characters.

Now I can start with getting the dataset going, firstly the dataset gets read when the server starts.
When a client connects the server sends over the column names so the client know the parameters for the different requests 
the client can ask.
