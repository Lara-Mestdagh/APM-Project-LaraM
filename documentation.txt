started with reading the assigment and making a TODO list of functionalities, I also looked up what some standard python folder
structure was and found the src method most logical

First I did some looking at the labs we made and searched online before finding customtinker. 
With this I first make a server that can connect with multiple clients, each client can message the server 
and the server can pick which clients to message. This took about a day of work

Next I started working on the login system, this gave me the most trouble but I looked up some examples of python server and client
log in systems to help me out. 
The plan is to keep the user details hashed in a txt file in my data folder.
I decided it was better to use a clienthandler and added this to the server folder, then I used pickle to get the login to work
